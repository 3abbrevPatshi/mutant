* Get a rid of heckle and test mutant with mutant.
  This is interesting IMHO mutant should have another entry point
  that does not create the ::Mutant namespace.
  This will be easy when there is a gem release.
  This ::Zombie namespace can be created with dynamically creating a 
  new library under a differend load path. Also a gem release 
  could provide this feature.
* Get a rid of rspec-1 (can be done once we do not use heckle anymore)
* Add an infrastructure to whitelist components to heckle.
