* Add a nice way to access the root ast to place the mutated ast nodes into.
* Get a rid of heckle and test mutant with mutant.
  This is interesting IMHO mutant should have another entry point
  that does not create the ::Mutant namespace, ideas:
  * ::Zombie namespace can be created with dynamically creating a 
    new library under a differend load path. 
  * This second entry point should NOT be a plain namespace alias, a full 
    copy of the library so the mutator does not mutate itself.
  * Maybe the full clone could be generated by evaluating the full mutant ast
    a second time with a differend module name ast node.
* Get a rid of rspec-1 (can be done once we do not use heckle anymore)
* Add an infrastructure to whitelist for components to heckle on ruby-1.8.
* Allow matches on attr_reader with literal name argument(s)?
* Allow matches on define_method with literal name argument?
* Make sure file is set in generated asts. Has a stupid default corrently.
